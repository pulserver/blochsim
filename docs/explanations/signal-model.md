# Signal model

```{admonition} TL;DR
:class: tldr

- A signal model is a {class}`~blochsim.model.Simulator` subclass: a handler per kind of event, and a layout of one repetition.
- The layout is the default description; a Pulseq file or an MRD stream can replace it, and the handlers still play every event.
- Batching, derivatives, devices, estimation and design are written once against this interface.
```

You give blochsim a sequence and a tissue, and it returns the signal and its
derivatives. The sequence is written once, as a signal model, and the 26
shipped simulators are written the same way as any you add.

## What blochsim does

::::{container} capabilities

- **Builds a sequence from a subclass that names its handlers and implements `layout`.**

  :::{dropdown} Show code and tests
  Code: {class}`~blochsim.model.Simulator`, {class}`~blochsim.model.EventOperators`. Tests: *a protocol with no layout says so*; *a trigger table defaults to the bare operators* (`test_state_machine.py`).
  :::
- **Composes operators with `@`, each starting where the previous one ends.**

  :::{dropdown} Show code and tests
  Code: `Operator.__matmul__`. Test: *a bare operator follows the one before it* (`test_operators.py`).
  :::
- **Takes the sequence parameters at construction, and lets a call override them.**

  :::{dropdown} Show code and tests
  Code: {meth}`~blochsim.model.Simulator.bind`. Test: *the protocol may be overridden per call* (`test_state_machine.py`).
  :::
- **Returns the description the layout produced, with the timestamp of every event.**

  :::{dropdown} Show code and tests
  Code: {meth}`~blochsim.model.Simulator.describe`. Test: *the repetition lasts as long as the operators do* (`test_description_helper.py`).
  :::
- **Simulates a description read from a Pulseq file or an MRD stream, skipping the layout.**

  :::{dropdown} Show code and tests
  Code: {meth}`~blochsim.model.Simulator.from_pulseq`, {meth}`~blochsim.model.Simulator.from_description`. Tests: *a description handed over whole skips the layout* (`test_state_machine.py`); *the steady state is the spoiled gradient echo closed form* (`test_pulseq_reader.py`).
  :::
- **Plays a read description through the handlers of the class it is given to, which supply the dephasing it does not carry.**

  :::{dropdown} Show code and tests
  Code: {meth}`~blochsim.model.Simulator.from_description`. Test: *which simulator reads a stream is what decides the dephasing* (`test_state_machine.py`).
  :::
- **Carries a tissue property into the kernels only when a call gives it as a map.**

  :::{dropdown} Show code and tests
  Code: {class}`~blochsim.model.SpinPhysics`. Tests: *a property the model does not declare stays out of the kernel*; *a declared property given a map reaches the kernel* (`test_signal_model.py`).
  :::
- **Accepts a closed form (`evaluate`) in place of a layout, with the same batching and derivatives.**

  :::{dropdown} Show code and tests
  Code: {meth}`~blochsim.model.Simulator.evaluate`. Test: *a closed form travels the same way* (`test_array_backends.py`).
  :::
- **Returns the signal in the array library it was given: NumPy, CuPy or PyTorch.**

  :::{dropdown} Show code and tests
  Code: {meth}`~blochsim.model.Simulator.simulate`. Test: *the signal comes back in the library it was asked in* (`test_array_backends.py`).

## What blochsim leaves out

- **Gradient waveforms and spatial encoding**, which belong to sequence design tools such as pypulseqpp. An event dephases by whole configuration orders.
- **The reconstruction encoding**, which a model-based reconstruction takes from mri-nufft or bartorch.
- **Safety checks** on gradients, PNS or SAR.

## How it works

```{figure} /generated/figures/signal_model.png
:width: 100%
:alt: Three sources of a description, the description, the handlers, and the signal.

A description comes from the layout, a Pulseq file or an MRD stream. The
handlers play its events, and the kernels return the signal and its
derivatives.
```

### Handlers

A handler is the operator for one kind of event: `excitation`, `refocusing`,
`inversion`, `saturation`, `readout` or `delay`. It decides, for example,
whether a readout is followed by an unbalanced gradient, ideal spoiling or a
rewinder. The tables `SPOILED`, `UNBALANCED`, `BALANCED` and `REFOCUSED` in
{mod}`blochsim.model` set these for the four sequence families.

### Layout

`layout` takes the sequence parameters in milliseconds and degrees, and
returns the operators of one repetition, built through `self.operators`, in
seconds and radians. The first call builds the description; later calls
rebind the numbers onto it. What is read from a file or stream is in
{doc}`description`, and the tissue physics in {doc}`epg`.
