# Extended phase graphs

```{admonition} TL;DR
:class: tldr

- A voxel is held as configuration states over integer dephasing orders; the signal is the order-zero transverse state.
- Pulses rotate within an order, gradients shift between orders, and relaxation, exchange, diffusion and flow act between events.
- Every term beyond $T_1$ and $T_2$ is a tissue property: $B_1$, $B_0$, $T_2'$, $D$, $v$, and up to five further pools.
```

You give a simulator a tissue, and the kernels carry its configuration states
through every event of the sequence. This page states which physics those
kernels hold. The derivations and the operator-by-operator detail are in
{doc}`../internals/epg`.

## What blochsim does

::::{container} capabilities

- **Carries the states $F^+_k$, $F^-_k$ and $Z_k$ up to the order set by `states`.**

  :::{dropdown} Show code and tests
  Code: {class}`~blochsim.model.Simulator` (`states`), `EpgEngine.simulate` (`nstates`). Tests: *a refocused train agrees echo for echo*; *a spoiled train agrees over two hundred repetitions* (`test_against_epgpy.py`).
  :::
- **Plays an unbalanced gradient as a shift by one order, and ideal spoiling as the loss of every transverse order.**

  :::{dropdown} Show code and tests
  Code: {func}`~blochsim.Dephase`, {func}`~blochsim.Spoil`. Tests: *the hyperecho train matches crushed isochromats*; *rf spoiled flash matches crushed isochromats* (`test_epg_trains.py`).
  :::
- **Scales each flip angle by $B_1$, turns its axis by the transmit phase, and combines per-channel sensitivities with a static RF shim.**

  :::{dropdown} Show code and tests
  Code: `transmit_field`, {class}`~blochsim.ShimDefinition`. Tests: *channels in antiphase cancel*; *the field is the complex sum written out* (`test_transmit_array.py`).
  :::
- **Integrates a shaped pulse into the rotation it performs across the slice, or per voxel when its channel weights vary while it plays.**

  :::{dropdown} Show code and tests
  Code: `exact_slice_profile`, `transition_table`, `dynamic_pair`. Tests: *the slice shows up when the pulse selects one* (`test_exact_profile.py`); *the pair is what exponentiating each sample gives* (`test_dynamic_transmit.py`).
  :::
- **Plays a waveform sample by sample, with relaxation, precession and exchange between samples.**

  :::{dropdown} Show code and tests
  Code: {func}`~blochsim.SampledPulse`. Test: *truefisp matches the bloch mcconnell equations* (`test_sampled_pulses.py`).
  :::
- **Applies a voxel's off-resonance $B_0$ and a Lorentzian field spread of width $1/T_2'$ within it.**

  :::{dropdown} Show code and tests
  Code: `TissueProperties` (`b0_hz`, `t2_prime_ms`). Tests: *a gradient echo decays at t2 star*; *a spin echo is left exactly as it stands* (`test_static_spread.py`); *the unrefocused time reproduces what the states compute* (`test_unrefocused_time.py`).
  :::
- **Couples to the free water a semisolid pool, saturated through a super-Lorentzian lineshape, and up to four chemically exchanging pools with their own $T_1$, $T_2$ and chemical shift.**

  :::{dropdown} Show code and tests
  Code: `TissueProperties` (`bound_fraction`, `pool_b_fraction` to `pool_e_fraction`), `lineshape_table`. Tests: *the canonical saturation matches the literature number* (`test_bound_pool.py`); *exchange washes the beat out* (`test_exchange.py`); *fast exchange precesses at the population average shift* (`test_many_pools.py`).
  :::
- **Damps each order by diffusion and turns it through a flow phase, both weighted by its order, and replaces spins that leave the voxel with relaxed, unexcited ones.**

  :::{dropdown} Show code and tests
  Code: `TissueProperties` (`diffusion_um2_per_ms`, `velocity_m_per_s`). Tests: *a declared crusher actually damps* (`test_diffusion_kernels.py`); *flow actually moves the signal* (`test_flow_kernels.py`); *washout only shrinks the signal* (`test_washout_kernels.py`).

## What blochsim leaves out

- **Gradient moments other than one per sequence.** Every unbalanced gradient winds one order, and diffusion and flow are scaled by one crusher moment, `crusher_dephasing_rad` across `voxel_size_m`. A bipolar pair or a velocity-encoding lobe has no representation.
- **Isochromat simulation.** A field distribution within the voxel is the Lorentzian $T_2'$ term on the samples, not a spatial ensemble.
- **Exchange between second pools.** Each exchanges with the free water alone, and the semisolid pool's $T_2$ is fixed at 12 µs.
- **Relaxation during a tabulated rotation.** A slice-profile or per-voxel rotation is a pure rotation; {func}`~blochsim.SampledPulse` is the route when relaxation during the pulse matters.

## How it works

```{figure} /generated/figures/epg_mechanism.png
:width: 100%
:alt: A phase graph of four refocusing pulses above simulated echo trains with B1, diffusion and a bound pool switched on in turn.

Above, the pathways of a refocused train: a pulse continues, reflects or
stores each state, and an echo forms where a transverse pathway reaches
$k = 0$. Below, the same train at 120° simulated with one tissue term at a
time; the crushers wind 20 turns across a 1 mm voxel.
```

### Configuration orders

A shift adds one order, and relaxation makes the far orders negligible. When
`states` is not given, it is one more than the shifts the played repetitions
contain, clamped to 8–64. The truncation error falls geometrically with the
number of orders, so a second run with more of them measures it.

### Which rotation a pulse takes

The RF definition decides, not the call: a rectangle without slice selection
is an instantaneous rotation, any other shape a Cayley–Klein pair tabulated
over slice position and effective flip angle, the hybrid Bloch–EPG treatment
of Guenthner et al.[^4]

### Off-resonance

Where the sequence winds at one steady rate, an order also measures how long a
state has dephased, and $B_0$ and $T_2'$ are applied to each sample from that
time: a gradient echo decays at $T_2^*$, a spin echo at $T_2$. Otherwise $B_0$
precesses the states interval by interval and $T_2'$ is refused.

The formalism follows Hennig[^1] and Weigel[^2], the second pools Malik et
al.[^3]
