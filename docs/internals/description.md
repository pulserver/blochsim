# Sequence description: reading rules

How a Pulseq file and an MRD stream are read into a
{class}`~blochsim.SequenceDescription`. What a description gives a simulator
is summarised on {doc}`../explanations/description`; how it is packed for the
kernels is {doc}`kernels`.

## Events

| Kind | Timestamp | Payload, in wire order |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `WAIT` | block start | none |
| `RF` | pulse isocentre, `delay + center` | definition id, use, amplitude, phase (rad), frequency offset (Hz), shim id, slice-select gradient (Hz/m) |
| `ADC` | sample nearest the readout's own $k = 0$ | role, phase (rad), echo flag |

Timestamps are in microseconds from the start of the repetition read. The
payload is positional, which is why an event's fields are reached through
named properties (`rf_amplitude_hz`, `adc_role`, ...) rather than by index.

Each event also carries an action word (`EventAction`): `CRUSH_BEFORE` and
`CRUSH_AFTER` around a refocusing pulse, `SHIFT_AFTER` and `SPOIL_AFTER` after
a sample. A description read from a file or a stream has no actions; they are
added when the events are re-emitted through a simulator's handlers.

### RF use

The use tag is Pulseq's: `EXCITATION`, `REFOCUSING`, `INVERSION`,
`SATURATION`, `PREPARATION`, `OTHER`, or `UNKNOWN` where the file is silent.
{meth}`~blochsim.model.Simulator.from_description` sends `REFOCUSING`,
`INVERSION` and `SATURATION` to the handlers of the same name and every other
use to `excitation`, so a refocusing pulse reaches the refocusing handler
whatever angle it turns.

### ADC role and echo flag

The role relates a sample to the other samples of its repetition: `SINGLE`
where a repetition takes one and where several are alike, `ECHO_CENTER` for
the one nearest the centre of a train whose samples are not alike,
`NON_CENTER` for the rest, and `NON_ACQUIRED` for a window that records
nothing. The echo flag says whether the position reaches $k = 0$.
`record="all"` keeps every ADC event, `"acquired"` those whose role is not
`NON_ACQUIRED`, and `"echo"` those flagged.

## Pulseq blocks to events

A Pulseq file is a table of blocks, each holding at most one RF pulse, one
gradient per axis and one ADC window. One block becomes one event: a block with
a pulse is an RF event, one with an ADC and no pulse an ADC event, any other a
WAIT. Gradients are not events.

The file is parsed and its trajectory computed by pypulseq
(`pip install blochsim[pulseq]`); a sequence in memory with pypulseq's reading
interface, pypulseq's or pypulseqpp's, is read the same way. The gradients are
read for two things only: the k-space trajectory that places each ADC event,
and the slice-select amplitude under each pulse's isocentre, recorded when
exactly one axis carries a gradient there.

### Which repetition

The `TRSize` definition states how many blocks one repetition holds, and
reading is refused without it: the period is declared by the design, not
searched for. The repetition read is, in order of precedence, `tr_index`
(counted in whole repetitions), the file's `TRRef` definition, and the first
repetition that acquires. The last is refused when the acquiring repetitions
play different pulses (compared by shape and flip angle, so an RF-spoiling
phase increment is no difference), as in an optimised echo train or a
fingerprinting schedule.

```python
from blochsim.simulators import FSESimulator

# The tissue is given; the echo spacing, the train length, the refocusing
# angle and the pulse shapes are read.
train = FSESimulator.from_pulseq("fse.seq", states=20)
signal = train.simulate(T1=830.0, T2=80.0)
```

## RF definitions

An RF event names a definition. Pulseq writes a library row per pulse
occurrence, so RF spoiling writes one row per repetition of the same shape;
rows with the same magnitude, phase and time shapes (normalised to their peak)
collapse onto one definition.

A definition can carry a phase per sample, sample times of its own, a
slice-select gradient per sample, up to eight frequency bands, and one envelope
per transmit channel. Which of those are present decides the rotation mode;
see {doc}`epg`.

### Flip angle

The flip angle of an event is $2\pi\,|A \int e(t)\,\mathrm{d}t|$ for the event
amplitude $A$ and the definition's envelope $e$, integrated on the RF raster
the description carries (`rf_raster_time_s`). Sample times are stored in units
of that raster, so a pulse whose dwell differs from the raster keeps its
duration; reading a description against a raster other than the one its shapes
were written on scales every flip angle by the ratio.

The two sources normalise differently:

| Source | Envelope | Event amplitude |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pulseq file, {func}`~blochsim.rf_definition` | integral $1/(2\pi)$ s | flip angle in radians |
| MRD stream | peak of one | Hz |

A Pulseq definition is read with no bandwidth, so a shaped pulse from a file is
integrated as non-selective, and the per-event slice-select gradient is not
read by any simulation. A pulse with unevenly spaced sample times is refused,
since a definition read from a file is played one sample per dwell.

## Echo detection

A Pulseq file does not say which sample is the echo; the trajectory
$k = \gamma \int G\,\mathrm{d}t$ does. A readout's centre is the sample where
the axes that readout sweeps come closest to zero, an axis being swept when
its span across the readout exceeds $10^{-6}$ of its largest absolute
coordinate there (or of 1 m$^{-1}$, whichever is larger).

```{figure} /generated/figures/description_echo.png
:width: 100%
:alt: Eight k-space lines, one through the origin, and their distances from it.

One repetition of a spin-echo train. Every readout sweeps through its own zero
in the readout direction; one of the eight is also at the centre of the
phase-encode direction.
```

Two questions follow, answered over every instance of an ADC position in the
file.

**Whether a position bears an echo** is absolute. Its smallest $|k|$ at the
centre sample is compared with the scan's own closest approach to $k = 0$,
within $10^{-5}$ of the largest coordinate the scan reaches plus $10^{-6}$
m$^{-1}$. A finite phase-encode offset stays out and accumulated
floating-point error stays in.

**What a position's role is** is structural. The norm is taken only along the
axes the readout sweeps, so a CPMG echo is central whatever line it encodes.
Where a repetition takes several samples, those within $10^{-3}$ of the
largest of these norms from the smallest are central and the rest
`NON_CENTER`. A single central sample is `ECHO_CENTER`; several central
samples, as every echo of a CPMG train or every blade of a PROPELLER, are all
`SINGLE`.

The train in the figure is the tied case: all eight roles are `SINGLE`, and one
echo flag is set.

## The MRD stream

Pulserver's reconstruction proxy reads the sequence file a series was played
from and sends its description after the MRD XML header and before the first
acquisition, as one `TEXT` message: a JSON object under the key
`pulserver_sequence_description`, holding one entry per file of the sequence
chain. {func}`~blochsim.read_mrd_description` reads the stream up to that
message, returns the XML header and the descriptions in play order, and leaves
the stream at the first acquisition. A message other than a filename, config,
header or text before the description is refused.

Each entry holds `subsequence_index`, `tr_duration_us`, `rf_raster_time_s`,
the events as three base64 arrays -- `type` (int32), `timestamp_us`
(float64) and `params` (float32, seven per event, in the wire order above) --
and `rf_definitions`, each with its bandwidth, bands, and Pulseq-compressed
magnitude, phase and time shapes. The stream carries no shim definitions, no
per-sample slice-select gradient, no crusher dephasing or voxel size, and no
event actions.

## Gradients

A Pulseq file has no gradient use, so a crusher cannot be told from a phase
encode without following the k-space moment through the whole repetition, and
an EPG simulation quantises that moment to whole orders. A description
therefore carries one dephasing for the sequence, `crusher_dephasing_rad`, the
turn one unbalanced gradient winds across a voxel of `voxel_size_m`; their
ratio scales diffusion and flow, and a dephasing of zero leaves both out.

Which gradients play around each pulse and sample comes from the simulator's
handlers (see {doc}`../explanations/signal-model`):

```python
from blochsim.simulators import FSESimulator, MRFSimulator

# The same file, read as a refocused train and as an unbalanced one.
refocused = FSESimulator.from_pulseq("scan.seq")
unbalanced = MRFSimulator.from_pulseq("scan.seq")
```

A moment that is not a whole number of orders has no representation: a bipolar
pair, a velocity-encoding lobe, a crusher of twice its neighbour's area. A
preparation's own spoiler does not survive either, since a handler reinstates
what a pulse or a sample implies and a gradient alone is neither.
