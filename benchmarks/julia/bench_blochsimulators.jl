# The fingerprinting dictionary, on BlochSimulators.jl's EPG simulator.
#
# `FISP2D` is the sequence this benchmark's task already is: an inversion, a
# variable flip-angle train at fixed TR, one sample per repetition at the echo
# time, and a spoiling shift at the end of each. Setting the echo time to zero
# puts the sample immediately after the excitation, which is where the other
# three backends take theirs.
#
# Two differences from the Python backends are structural rather than
# incidental, and are recorded in the note of every record written here:
#
#   * `FISP2D` requires the number of configuration states to be a multiple of
#     32, so the shared task carries 32 orders rather than 20.
#   * A real `RF_train` keeps the configuration states real, which is the same
#     specialization BlochSim applies when a sequence earns it. The train here
#     has no phase, so both packages take their real path.
#
# Run as (from the repository root):

#     julia -t 4 --project=benchmarks/julia benchmarks/julia/bench_blochsimulators.jl --atoms 10000
#     julia --project=benchmarks/julia benchmarks/julia/bench_blochsimulators.jl --atoms 100000 --device cuda
#
# Derivatives are `--mode jacobian`, which is what MR-STAT does: a forward
# difference per parameter, so three passes for two parameters.
#
# `--device cuda` swaps the `CPUThreads` resource for `CUDALibs` and moves the
# sequence and the parameters onto the card; the arithmetic and the task are
# the same, and the number of threads then names only the process doing the
# launching.
