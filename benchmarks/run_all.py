"""Drive the whole sweep, one subprocess per point, and write the table.

Each measurement runs in a process of its own so that the peak resident set it
reports is its own -- an import of PyTorch costs several hundred megabytes and
would otherwise be charged to whichever backend ran first.

A backend whose package is not installed is skipped with a line saying so, so
this runs usefully with any subset of them present. The Julia backends need a
``julia`` on the path (or ``JULIA`` in the environment pointing at one) and the
project in ``benchmarks/julia`` instantiated; ``benchmarks/setup.sh`` does all
of that.

Run as ``python benchmarks/run_all.py``; ``--quick`` cuts the sizes down,
``--backends`` picks a subset and ``--device cuda`` puts every backend that can
reach a card on one. Sycomore and epgpy have no device to be placed on and are
skipped there; a record's tag carries the device, so the two sweeps sit beside
each other in ``results/``.
