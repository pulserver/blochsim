"""What BlochSim's own runtime is made of, on one CPU core count.

Four experiments, each isolating one thing the dictionary benchmark cannot:

**What the structure costs.** Resolving a sequence walks its events, packs
them and learns the affine rebinding, once per sequence shape; a call
afterwards rebinds values onto what it found. Both are timed at one tissue, so
what is measured is the structure rather than the dictionary.

**Fixed cost against state cost.** Run the same schedule at several
configuration-order counts. The state arithmetic scales with the orders; the
per-event work that does not -- the two exponentials, the loads, the branches --
is the intercept. That intercept is the ceiling on what hoisting relaxation
factors out of the event loop could ever buy.

**The real subspace against the complex path.** Run one refocused train twice,
with the excitation in phase with the refocusing pulses and a quarter turn from
them. The event stream, the order count and the arithmetic content are
identical; only the subspace verdict differs, so the ratio is what that
specialization is worth. (The two are different sequences and produce different
signals -- what is being compared is the cost of the same amount of work.)

**Whether the fast path is reached at all.** The same pass with the verdict
forced to the real kernels, to the complex ones, and left to decide for
itself. Where deciding costs what forcing costs, the decision is right and any
distance left is the kernel's; where it costs what the complex kernel costs,
the verdict is not reaching it. This is the one to run first on a card, since
it separates a plumbing problem from an arithmetic one without needing to know
what either should cost.

Run as ``python benchmarks/anatomy.py [--device cuda]``.
