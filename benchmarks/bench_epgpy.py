"""The same fingerprinting dictionary, on epgpy's operator-per-event EPG.

Epgpy is the closest thing to BlochSim in Python: NumPy under the hood, the
dictionary carried in the array shape rather than in a loop, analytic first-
and second-order derivatives, and CuPy for a card. What it does not do is fuse:
each operator is a pass over the whole state matrix, so a train of a thousand
events is a thousand passes over an array the size of the dictionary. That is
the axis this benchmark measures.

Install it from its repository -- it is not on PyPI:

    pip install git+https://github.com/py-baudin/epgpy
