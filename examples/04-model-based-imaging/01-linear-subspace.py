=========================
Subspace reconstruction
=========================

In this Application you reconstruct one undersampled radial multi-echo spin
echo three ways: by gridding, by conjugate gradients on each echo separately,
and in a linear subspace. You compare what each costs and how far its T2 map is
from the truth.

Quantitative maps are usually obtained in two steps: reconstruct one image per
contrast, then fit the maps voxel by voxel. The first step recovers eight images
from undersampled data although each voxel has two unknowns. The multi-echo
signals span far fewer directions than there are echoes, so you can
reconstruct the coefficients along those directions instead. This reduces the
number of unknowns and couples the echoes.

Prerequisites: Course lessons :doc:`../01-framework/01-first-simulation`.

# Eight echoes of one exponential is the case a subspace handles best: three
# directions hold essentially all of the signal. Two things break that.
#
# - A phase-modulated signal, such as a balanced steady state through a field
#   map or a fingerprinting train with varying RF phase, needs tens of
#   components. The coefficient problem then is no smaller than the image
#   problem.
# - A model with several parameters has no small basis, because the basis must
#   span the product of their ranges.
#
# Both cases require the model inside the operator. That is the nonlinear route of
# :doc:`02-nonlinear-inversion`.

# What this Application did, stated the way you would ask an agent for it:
#
# .. code-block:: text
#
#    With blochsim, mri-nufft and deepinv, simulate an 8-echo multi-echo spin
#    echo (TE 10 to 150 ms) on a BrainWeb T2 phantom of 96 x 96 voxels. Sample
#    each echo with 16 golden-angle radial spokes of 192 samples. Fit a rank-3
#    temporal basis with a DictionaryMatcher and check how much signal it keeps.
#    Reconstruct T2 by gridding, by CG per echo, and by CG on the subspace
#    coefficients. Report the time and the mean T2 error over the brain of each.
