================================
Nonlinear inversion from k-space
================================

In this Application you reconstruct T2 maps directly from k-space, with the
signal model inside the forward operator, and compare the result with gridding
followed by a fit.

The forward operator is the chain

.. math::

   F = P \\, \\mathcal{F} \\, C \\, M

of sampling :math:`P`, Fourier encoding :math:`\\mathcal{F}`, coil sensitivities
:math:`C` and the signal model :math:`M` [1]_. Only :math:`M` changes with the
sequence, and it is the only factor blochsim supplies: a
:class:`~blochsim.recon.ModelOperator` wraps any simulator as :math:`M`. The
problem is nonlinear in the maps, so it needs a starting guess and an outer
Gauss-Newton loop. In exchange the model can have any number of parameters,
where a linear subspace would have to span the product of their ranges.

Prerequisites: Course lessons :doc:`../01-framework/01-first-simulation` and
:doc:`../01-framework/03-custom-signal-model`.

# -----
#
# blochsim simulates the signal. The radial trajectory and the non-uniform
# Fourier transform come from mri-nufft. deepinv provides the

# the linear solver that each Gauss-Newton step calls. Any encoding that provides
# ``A`` and ``A_adjoint`` works with them.

# Signal model
# ------------
#
# The model stays in the forward operator and the maps are solved for against
# k-space. You declare two things:
#
# - the unknowns: ``T2`` and the complex amplitude the operator carries with it,
#   which combines proton density and receive phase;
# - the range of T2. The bound is enforced by solving for a transformed
#   variable, so no iterate leaves it. This matters more here than in a voxelwise
#   fit, because the model is evaluated in every voxel to predict every k-space
#   sample, and one unphysical voxel corrupts the whole residual.

# %%
# Gauss-Newton solve
# ------------------
#
# Each iteration linearizes the model at the current maps, solves the linearized
# least-squares problem and steps, then lowers the damping (iteratively
# regularized Gauss-Newton). blochsim provides the loop and the derivative.
# :func:`~blochsim.recon.iterative` hands each linearized problem to the deepinv
# solver used for the baseline; replacing that argument changes the solver, for
# example to a proximal one with a wavelet prior.

#
# .. code-block:: text
#
#    With blochsim, mri-nufft and deepinv, simulate an 8-echo multi-echo spin
#    echo (TE 10 to 150 ms) on a BrainWeb T2 phantom of 96 x 96 voxels, sampled
#    by 16 golden-angle radial spokes per echo. Reconstruct T2 two ways: gridding
#    followed by a dictionary match, and a ModelOperator over the simulator with
#    T2 bounded to 20-400 ms, solved by Gauss-Newton from a T2 of 100 ms.
#    Report time and mean T2 error over the brain, the time of each Jacobian
#    product, and the size of the Jacobian that the operator avoids storing.
