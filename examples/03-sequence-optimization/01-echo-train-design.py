===============================
Echo train design for sharpness
===============================

In this example you design the refocusing flip angles of a fast spin echo for
image quality rather than for precision: first one echo train, then a whole
segmented 3D protocol in which each shot has its own repetition time, echo
train length and angles.

T2 decay along a long train modulates k-space. That modulation is a point
spread function, so the refocusing angles set the resolution of the image [1]_.
You design the angles against a cost that measures this blur, the contrast
between tissues and the RF power.

Prerequisites: Course lesson :doc:`../01-framework/01-first-simulation`.

# Design problem
# --------------
#
# A design has three pieces. A simulator with the tissue fixed on it, a cost
# written on the signal it records, and the bounded parameters that
# :class:`~blochsim.SequenceDesign` adjusts to lower the cost.
#
# The tissues are those of a PD-weighted knee protocol, read for the
# separation between fluid and cartilage. The design uses all three at once, so
# that the train is not tailored to one of them. T1 and T2 are in
# milliseconds:
import torch

from blochsim.optim import Bounded, SequenceDesign
from blochsim.simulators import FSESimulator

TISSUES = {
    #            cartilage  muscle  synovial fluid
    "T1": [1200.0, 1420.0, 3600.0],
    "T2": [35.0, 30.0, 250.0],
}
CARTILAGE, MUSCLE, FLUID = 0, 1, 2

# %%
# Blur
# ----
#
# Let the echo index run along one k-space direction. The magnitude of the echo
# train is then the k-space modulation, and the width of its Fourier transform
# is the blur it adds. You can read that width off the modulation without a
# transform: the second moment of :math:`|\mathcal{F}w|^2` is the energy in the
# slope of the train :math:`w` divided by the energy in :math:`w`.
#
# A train that stops early contributes fewer terms, so trains of different
# lengths compare on the same footing. The second half of this example needs
# that. ``signal`` is ``(shots, tissues, echoes)`` and ``acquired`` is
# ``(shots, echoes)``, one where the shot is still acquiring. The result is the
# blur in pixels, ``(shots, tissues)``:


def blur(signal, acquired):
    pair = acquired[:, None, :-1] * acquired[:, None, 1:]
    step = torch.diff(signal, dim=-1) * pair
    energy = (signal * acquired[:, None, :]).square().sum(-1).clamp_min(1e-12)
    lines = acquired.sum(-1)[:, None]
    return lines / (2 * torch.pi) * (step.square().sum(-1) / energy).sqrt()


# %%
# Echo train
# ----------
#
# A 120-echo train has 120 angles but three degrees of freedom:
#
# - the minimum angle, which sets how much flow and motion spoil the train;
# - the angle at the centre of k-space, which sets the image contrast;
# - the maximum angle, which the deposited RF power limits.
#
# The train starts at the maximum, drops to the minimum as the pseudo steady
# state is established, rises to the centre-of-k-space angle where the centre of
# k-space is sampled, and ramps back up to the maximum:
ESP_MS = 5.0

# As a spec
# ---------
#
# What this example did, stated the way you would ask an agent for it:
#
# .. code-block:: text
#
#    With blochsim, design the refocusing angles of a 120-echo fast spin echo
#    for a knee (cartilage, muscle, synovial fluid; ESP 5 ms, TR 1800 ms).
#    Parameterize the train by its minimum, centre-of-k-space and maximum
#    angles, bounded to what the scanner plays. Minimize the blur of the echo
#    train, minus the fluid-to-cartilage contrast at the centre, under an RF
#    power budget. Show the point spread and a phantom image before and after.
#    Then design a segmented 3D protocol whose repetition time, train length
#    and angles transition cubically from the centre to the periphery of
#    k-space, under a scan-time budget of 300 s.
