"""
==================================
Joint relaxometry protocol design
==================================

In this example you choose the flip angles of a DESPOT protocol so that a joint
fit of T1 and T2 is as precise as possible [1]_. DESPOT estimates T1 from
spoiled gradient-echo scans at several flip angles and T2 from balanced SSFP
scans. A joint fit uses all the data for both parameters.

The cost is a Cramer-Rao bound: the lowest variance an unbiased estimate can
have, given the derivative of the signal with respect to every parameter
estimated. You minimize it over the flip angles, then play the designed
protocol on a BrainWeb slice and compare the error of the fitted maps with the
bound.

# A design has three pieces. A simulator with the tissue fixed on it, so that
# only the parameters under design are left to give. A cost. And the bounded
# parameters that :class:`~blochsim.SequenceDesign` adjusts.
#
# Here the simulators are an SPGR and a bSSFP sequence, both in closed form.
# You construct and call them the same way as a sequence that plays events. The
# tissues are white and grey matter at 3 T, and you design for both at once.
# ``NOISE`` is the noise standard deviation as a fraction of the fully relaxed
# magnetization:

# The two sequences carry different information. The spoiled steady state in
# closed form depends on T2* and not on T2, so its T2 row is exactly zero. Each
# block is blind to something, and the Fisher matrix adds them up. ``rows``
# stacks the derivatives of one block with a zero row for each parameter it is
