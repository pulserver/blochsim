=====================================
T2 mapping by nonlinear least squares
=====================================

You map T2 from a multi-echo spin echo by nonlinear least squares and compare
the result with dictionary matching on the same slice.

The comparison turns on a nuisance parameter. A magnitude reconstruction sits
on a noise floor, so the decay does not reach zero. Unlike the proton density,
this offset does not divide out of a normalized match: ignoring it biases T2,
and adding it to the dictionary multiplies the number of atoms. A fit instead
adds one column to the Jacobian, at the cost of no guarantee that it finds the
global minimum.

# Interpretation
# --------------
#
# The T2-only match is the fastest method here and the least accurate: the
# model it matches is not the model that produced the data. The residual it
# minimizes is small, at the wrong T2, and the estimator does not report the
# mismatch.
#
# With the offset on the grid the match recovers. The cost is the number of
# offset values: ten values multiply the number of atoms and the memory by ten,
# for a parameter that adds one column to the fit's Jacobian.
#
# The fit is slower in wall-clock time, because a Levenberg-Marquardt loop takes
# tens of passes where a match takes one. Each additional nuisance parameter
# multiplies the number of atoms but adds one column to the Jacobian, so the
# time curves cross at some number of nuisance values, and the memory curves
# have already crossed.

# %%
# Limits
# ------
#
# The fit has no guarantee of reaching the global minimum. Here it started every
# voxel at 100 ms and converged to the correct T2 everywhere, because the
# residual of a single exponential decay has one minimum. A model whose
# residual has several, such as a fingerprinting train or a fat-water fit at a
# wrong field map, can start in the wrong basin and stay there. A match cannot,
# because it scores every atom.
#
# Equality constraints belong in the model, not in the bounds. Two fractions
# that sum to one are written with one as the unknown and the other as ``1 - f``
# inside the model, so the constraint holds at every iterate.
#
# As a spec
# ---------
#
# What this page did, stated the way you would ask an agent for it:
#
# .. code-block:: text
#
#    With blochsim, map T2 in BrainWeb subject 0, slice 90, from a 16-echo
#    multi-echo spin echo (TE 10 to 200 ms) with a constant noise-floor offset
#    of 0.05 and Gaussian noise of 0.005. Fit T2, M0 and the offset with
#    NonlinearLeastSquares (bounds T2 10-500 ms, M0 0.1-2, offset 0-0.2).
#    Compare with a DictionaryMatcher over 400 log-spaced T2 values, without
#    the offset and with 10 to 80 offset values on the grid. Report mapping
#    time, estimator memory and median relative T2 error, and plot the maps.
