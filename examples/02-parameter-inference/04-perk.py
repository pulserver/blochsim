=============================
PERK: kernel ridge regression
=============================

You map T1, T2 and proton density in a brain slice with PERK, vary the size of
the regression, and read the uncertainty it reports against the Cramér-Rao
bound.

PERK builds no dictionary. It is a kernel regression trained on signals drawn
from a prior instead of laid on a grid. At inference it projects a signal onto
a fixed set of random Fourier features and reads the estimate off a linear
combination of them. The cost per voxel does not depend on the number of
unknown parameters, and the training is paid once.

Prerequisites: Course lesson :doc:`../01-framework/01-first-simulation`.

#    inversion-prepared MRF train of 400 repetitions at 2% noise. Fit a PERK
#    regression (20 000 log-uniform training draws, subspace rank 4, 500, 1000
#    and 4000 random Fourier features) and compare it with a rank-4
#    DictionaryMatcher on the cost table and the maps. Return the PERK
#    uncertainty and compare it with the Cramér-Rao bound computed from the
#    simulator Jacobian.
