===================
2. Advanced physics
===================

In lesson 1 a tissue was T1 and T2. A voxel has more properties than that, and
each one adds a term to the physics. In this lesson you add them to a
fingerprinting train one at a time: the transmit field and the array that
produces it, the shaped pulse of a real slice selection, a second exchanging
pool and a bound pool, off resonance, an imperfect inversion, and diffusion and
flow.

**Learning objectives**

- Turn a physics term on by naming the tissue property in the call.
- Describe a transmit array with per-channel sensitivities and an RF shim.
- Simulate a shaped RF pulse across the slice.
- Add an exchanging pool and a bound pool to a voxel.
- Know that a property held at its neutral value costs nothing.

Previous: :doc:`01-first-simulation`. Next: :doc:`03-custom-signal-model`,
where you write a sequence of your own.

# .. code-block:: text
#
#    With blochsim, simulate an inversion-prepared MRF train of 400 repetitions
#    (TR 10 ms, flip 5 to 55 to 5 degrees) in a voxel with T1 1 s and T2 80 ms.
#    Add, one at a time and by naming the tissue property: B1 scaling, a
#    four-channel transmit array with an RF shim, an SLR pulse integrated across
#    the slice, a second free pool and a bound pool (white matter, Malik 2018),
#    B0 on a balanced readout, inversion efficiency, and diffusion and flow.
#    Check that each property at its neutral value reproduces the baseline.
