==================
5. Custom operator
==================

In lesson 3 you wrote a sequence from the operators that ship with blochsim.
In this lesson you write two operators of your own: a T2 preparation, and a
readout that records two samples in one repetition. An operator is a Python
function that returns events, and ``@`` composes operators into one. No kernel
changes, and the new operators work in any simulator.

**Learning objectives**

- Write a preparation by composing the shipped operators with ``@``.
- Play it from the layout of a simulator.
- Write a readout that takes two samples per repetition.
- Check an operator against a closed form or a shipped sequence.

# A preparation
# -------------
#
# A T2 preparation weights the magnetization by its transverse decay before the
# readout. It tips the magnetization into the transverse plane, lets it decay
# for the echo time TE_prep around a refocusing pulse, tips what is left back
# along z, and spoils whatever did not come back.
#
# Each of those steps is an operator that ships with blochsim, so ``@`` is all
# you write. The refocusing pulse is requested without crushers
# (``crushed=False``): this refocusing must form an echo, and the crusher pair
# that :func:`~blochsim.Refocusing` adds by default would spoil it.

# The two agree to about 0.2%. The remainder is physics, not error: the
# magnetization tipped back up recovers a little during the spoiler that
# follows, and more of it does so after the longer preparations, which leave
# less behind.
#
# A readout
# ---------
#
# The shipped readouts differ in what they play around the sample. In an
# unbalanced steady-state train each repetition winds every configuration order
# on by one. A sample taken *before* that winding is a free induction decay
# (FID) after the pulse just played. A sample taken *after* it sits where the
# next pulse will refocus the previous excitation: an echo, and far more
# strongly T2-weighted.
#
# blochsim ships these as :func:`~blochsim.SSFPFidReadout` and
# :func:`~blochsim.SSFPEchoReadout`. Recording both in one repetition is a
# double-echo steady state (DESS), and you write it by putting the winding
# between two samples:
from blochsim import Dephase, Readout


def dess_readout(phase_rad=0.0, *, duration_s=0.0):
    """Two samples, with the winding between them, then a wait."""
    return Readout(phase_rad) @ Dephase() @ Readout(phase_rad) @ Delay(duration_s)


# %%
# Use it as the readout handler of a steady-state sequence. The sequence is one
# excitation and one readout per repetition, with the repetition time as the
# readout's wait:
FLIP, TR, REPETITIONS = 30.0, 20.0, 64

    excitation = Excitation
    readout = dess_readout

            self.operators.readout(duration_s=TR * 1e-3),
        ]


# %%
# Check it against the shipped readouts. The first sample has to be what an
# FID train records and the second what an echo train records, since those are
# the same two samples taken one at a time. Changing the readout handler is all
# that separates the three simulators:

# %%
# The ratio rises with T2 at every T1 and moves much less with T1 than with T2.
# That makes it usable as a T2 contrast. It also means that a DESS T2
# measurement at a larger flip angle needs T1 to be known.
#
# Limits
# ------
#
# A preparation, a readout, or a shaped or per-channel pulse is built from the
# shipped operators and reaches the kernels unchanged.
#
# An event cannot say *how much* a gradient dephases. A sequence carries one
# crusher moment, and dephasing comes in whole configuration orders. A bipolar
# pair, a velocity-encoding moment of its own, or a crusher of twice the area
# of its neighbour cannot be written as operators. They need a gradient moment
# per event through the packed layout and every kernel, which is a change to
# blochsim itself.
#
# As a spec
# ---------
#
# What this lesson built, stated the way you would ask an agent for it:
#
# .. code-block:: text
#
#    Write two blochsim operators by composition with @. A T2 preparation:
#    90 degree pulse, wait TE/2, uncrushed 180 degree refocusing, wait TE/2,
#    -90 degree pulse, short wait, spoiler. Check the first echo of a spin echo
#    train that follows it against exp(-TE/T2). A DESS readout: sample, dephase,
#    sample, wait. Use it as the readout handler of a steady-state Simulator
#    (30 degrees, TR 20 ms) and check its two samples against the shipped
#    SSFPFidReadout and SSFPEchoReadout.
