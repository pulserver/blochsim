========================
1. Your first simulation
========================

blochsim computes the signal of an MR sequence for given tissue properties,
together with its derivatives with respect to those properties and to the
sequence parameters. This lesson uses the fast spin echo (FSE) simulator
shipped with blochsim: you simulate three tissues, change the refocusing
angle, and compute the derivative of the signal with respect to T2.

**Learning objectives**

- Construct a shipped simulator and evaluate it for several tissues.
- Take the derivative of the signal with respect to a tissue property.
- Choose how many configuration states to keep, and where the simulation runs.

Next: :doc:`02-advanced-physics`, where the same sequence meets B1, off
resonance, magnetization transfer, diffusion and flow.

# Your sequence
# -------------
#
# The sequence is a CPMG echo train: a 90-degree excitation followed by 48
# refocusing pulses, echo spacing (ESP) 5 ms, repetition time 3 s.
#
# Each shipped sequence is a *simulator* class, constructed from its sequence
# parameters. Times are in milliseconds and angles in degrees. The refocusing
# angles are given per echo, so variable flip angle trains use the same
# interface.

# Changing the sequence
# ---------------------
#
# Clinical FSE protocols often use refocusing angles below 180 degrees to
# reduce SAR, which scales with the square of the flip angle. At 60 degrees more
# coherence pathways contribute, so more configuration states are retained
# (``states``, discussed below):

# %%
# With 60-degree refocusing, part of the magnetization is stored along z and
# returns as stimulated echoes. The first echoes oscillate before the train
# approaches a pseudo steady state, and the late echoes decay more slowly than
# exp(-TE/T2). blochsim models all coherence pathways with the extended phase
# graph (EPG) formalism; see the :doc:`EPG explanation </explanations/epg>`.
#
# Derivative with respect to the tissue
# -------------------------------------
#
# Model-based T2 fitting, as well as Cramér-Rao bound analysis, needs the
# derivative of the signal with respect to T2. ``jacobian`` returns the signal
# and its derivatives with respect to the named properties:
signal, dT2 = fse.jacobian("T2", flip=flip, T1=1000.0, T2=T2)

# %%
# The derivative is computed in forward mode alongside the signal, not by
# finite differences. As a check, compare it with a forward difference over a
# 1 ms step:
step = 1.0
finite = (fse.simulate(flip=flip, T1=1000.0, T2=T2 + step) - signal) / step

error = (dT2 - finite).abs().max() / dT2.abs().max()

# %%
# The two agree to within the truncation error of the finite difference. The
# sensitivity to T2 peaks at TE close to T2. Passing several names,
# ``jacobian(("T1", "T2"), ...)``, returns one derivative per property.
#
# How exact, and where it runs
# ----------------------------
#
# Two settings control accuracy and cost. Both can be passed to the
# constructor or to the call.
#
# ``states`` is the number of EPG configuration states retained. A train of N
# refocusing pulses populates at most N states, so 48 is exact here. The FSE
# simulator defaults to 10, which is sufficient for near-180-degree trains.
# Truncation is a systematic error, so check it against the exact number when
# the refocusing angle is low:
flip60 = torch.full((48,), 60.0)
reference = fse.simulate(flip=flip60, T1=1000.0, T2=T2, states=48)
for states in (10, 24, 32):
    approximate = fse.simulate(flip=flip60, T1=1000.0, T2=T2, states=states)
    error = (approximate - reference).abs().max() / reference.abs().max()
    print(f"{states:2d} states: {error:.0%} off")

# %%
# The 60-degree train requires the full 48 states, which the previous figure
# used.
#
# ``blochsim.execution`` selects the device. The default, ``"auto"``, runs
# small problems on the CPU and large ones on a GPU when available, split
# into chunks when they exceed device memory. A named device overrides this:
import blochsim

with blochsim.execution("cpu"):
    on_cpu = fse.simulate(flip=flip, T1=1000.0, T2=T2)

# %%
# The first call resolves the sequence structure; later calls only rebind
# numerical values. Construct a simulator once and reuse it inside loops.
#
# Each shipped sequence also has a functional form, convenient for one-off
# calls:
signal, dT2 = blochsim.fse_sim(
    flip=flip, ESP=5.0, TR=3000.0, T1=1000.0, T2=T2, diff="T2"
)

# %%
# As a spec
# ---------
#
# What this lesson did, stated the way you would ask an agent for it:
#
# .. code-block:: text
#
#    With blochsim, simulate a fast spin echo of 48 echoes, 5 ms apart, TR 3 s,
#    in white matter, grey matter and CSF (T1 1 s; T2 80, 110 and 2000 ms).
#    Compare 180 and 60 degree refocusing trains. Return the derivative of the
#    signal with respect to T2, checked against a finite difference, and check
#    that the number of configuration states kept is enough for the 60 degree
#    train.
