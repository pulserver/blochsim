"""What a resolved simulator promises, and what it refuses to promise.

A binding exists for speed, so every test here is really the same question in
a different place: does going fast change the answer. The two that matter most
are the ones asserting a *route* -- that the packer was not reached, and that
it was -- because agreement alone cannot tell a binding that worked from one
that silently was not built.
