"""The GPU kernels for tabulated pools, run on the host against the C++ ones.

The device kernels meet the host ones on the same buffers: the tables, the
trajectory the adjoint records and walks back, the per-problem cotangent slots
and every rotation mode. The C++ kernels are held to the state machine written
out in torch by ``tests/sequence/test_many_pools.py``; these hold the GPU
kernels to them, to float32 round-off.

``pools`` is the exchanging pool count followed by ``s`` for a semisolid pool
or ``f`` for none. ``trains`` packs two trains of different lengths and
flips, ``chunked`` records one problem at a time, and ``undeclared`` turns
off every optional term the tissue does not declare.
