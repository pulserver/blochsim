"""The packed state machine written out in torch, as an oracle for the kernels.

Every tensor operation here is one autograd knows how to differentiate, to any
order, so this doubles as the reference for the analytic first- and
second-order adjoints. It takes the same packed buffers the kernels do --
``_pack_events`` output, and prepared tissue -- so a parity test can feed both
from one place.

It is deliberately slow and deliberately naive: it composes whole-array
operations per event with no fusion and no state truncation, which is what
makes it independent of the kernels it checks. Both two-pool steps go further
and reach their exponential through ``torch.matrix_exp``, so the closed form
the kernels evaluate is checked against a different algorithm and not against
a second copy of itself.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tissue
        The prepared tissue properties in packing order, one entry per voxel.
    events
        ``(duration, kind, flip, phase, action, output_index)``, one entry per
        event, for a single train.
    state_count
        Configuration orders to carry.
    output_count
        Recorded echoes, used only for the shape of an empty result.
    geometry
        The two scales the velocity is read through, exactly as the kernels
        take them.
    profile
        A :class:`~blochsim.sequence._transition.TransitionTable`, or ``None``
        for the instantaneous pulse. Given one, a pulse turns through the
        rotation the table holds at its effective flip rather than through a
        flip and a phase.
    dynamic
        A :class:`~blochsim.sequence._transition.DynamicPairs`, for a pulse
        whose channel weights vary while it plays. The rotation is already
        integrated at that pulse's own flip, so only the event's phase is left
        to apply. Mutually exclusive with ``profile``: a pair integrated at the
        voxel's own position is a slice profile, and an exact one.
    locations
        Slice positions each voxel was spread over. The prepared tissue runs
        voxel-major, so a voxel's position along the slice is its index modulo
        this, which is the row of the table it reads.
    lineshape
        A :class:`~blochsim.sequence._lineshape.LineshapeTable`, or ``None``
        for a single pool. Given one, the longitudinal step carries a bound
        pool alongside the free water and each pulse saturates it.
    exchanging
        Whether to carry a chemically exchanging pool: a second pool with a
        transverse pair of its own, its own T2 and chemical shift, which a
        pulse rotates rather than saturates. Given beside a ``lineshape`` this
        is the three-pool system, whose longitudinal step is a 3x3 while its
        transverse one stays the 2x2 the exchanging pool alone needs.

    Returns
    -------
    torch.Tensor
        Complex signal of shape ``(voxels, recorded echoes)``.

    events, state_count, output_count, geometry, profile, dynamic, locations

    lineshape
        A :class:`~blochsim.sequence._lineshape.LineshapeTable` for a
