"""What an estimator says the answer is worth.

:meth:`map` asked with ``uncertainty=True`` returns a second set of maps: how
far the answer is expected to sit from the truth. PERK learns that during
training, from the residuals of its own fit, so reporting it is a matrix
multiply rather than a rerun; least squares reads it off the curvature at its
solution.

Both are checked here against a Monte Carlo written out in the test -- draw
the noise, map each realization, measure the scatter -- because that is the
definition, and because it shares nothing with the closed forms it checks.
A Monte Carlo over ``n`` draws knows its own answer to about
``1 / sqrt(2 (n - 1))``, which is why the tolerances are percentages.
