"""What a spread of the field across a voxel does to a sample.

A voxel is not one frequency. Where the field varies across it, the spins
inside dephase against each other, and a Lorentzian spread of half-width
``1 / T2'`` damps a sample by ``exp(-|tau| / T2')`` in the time ``tau`` it has
gone unrefocused -- growing either side of a spin echo and never recovering
after a gradient echo.

These hold that against things outside BlochSim: the characteristic function of
the Cauchy distribution, summed here over a quadrature rather than taken on
trust, and the closed form ``T2*`` a gradient echo decays at. The ensemble is
also played through the states themselves, so the claim that a spread and a
population of frequencies are the same thing is checked and not asserted.
