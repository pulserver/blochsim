"""Spreading echo trains over several CUDA devices.

Sharding has to be invisible: the same call, split any number of ways, must
give back the same answer in the same shape. The partitioning itself is checked
on its own, because it is pure arithmetic and does not need a second GPU to be
wrong.

This machine has one GPU, so the execution tests name ``cuda:0`` repeatedly.
That exercises the partition, the per-shard slicing, the gather and the
gradient reduction; it does not exercise a real transfer between two devices.
