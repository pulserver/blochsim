"""The same sequences, run by another EPG library.

Every other test in this suite is BlochSim measured against a closed form, a
published figure, or an integration written out beside it. This one is
BlochSim measured against a second implementation of the whole formalism:
`epgpy <https://github.com/py-baudin/epgpy>`_, which shares no code, no author
and no array library with this one.

What that catches is a convention the closed forms are blind to -- which way a
phase turns, where a gradient winds, what a readout is taken relative to --
because two libraries agreeing on a hundred echoes of a spoiled train have to
agree on all of it.

epgpy is not on PyPI, so this is skipped unless it has been installed by hand:
``pip install git+https://github.com/py-baudin/epgpy``.
