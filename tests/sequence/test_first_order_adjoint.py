"""The device adjoint that carries no forward direction.

A first-order adjoint needs no dual, and on a device it is its own kernel
rather than the forward-over-reverse pass handed a direction of zeros. These
pin it against that pass -- the route the gradient took before it existed --
because two kernels agreeing is the only evidence that stripping the dual left
the answer alone.
