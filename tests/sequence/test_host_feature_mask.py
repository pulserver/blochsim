"""The mask the host kernels read, against the same launch carrying everything.

The Triton backend takes a flag per term because each one compiles a kernel of
its own; the host kernels take one integer and branch on it at run time. These
pin the two ends together -- that the mask says what
:func:`blochsim.sequence._parameters.feature_flags` says, and that a host
kernel told to drop a term gives the answer it gives when told to keep it.
