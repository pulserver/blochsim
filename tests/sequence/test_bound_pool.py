"""A bound proton pool on the longitudinal axis, through the fused kernels.

Every tissue holds a share of its protons bound to macromolecules. That pool
has essentially no T2, so it never shows up in a signal directly; it reaches
one by exchanging magnetization with the free water, and by absorbing RF power
that the free water at the same offset does not. What the kernels carry is
therefore asymmetric -- ``F+`` and ``F-`` stay single-pool and only the ``Z``
step and the RF operator change -- and these tests pin each half of that.

The same asymmetry runs through all four passes: forward, forward mode, the
adjoint and the pass that differentiates the adjoint.
