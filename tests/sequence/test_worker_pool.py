"""What a job leaves behind for the next one on the same thread.

The kernels are multiversioned, so a pass may run a clone built for a wider
instruction set than the code around it. On Intel parts that leaves the vector
registers in a state every later SSE-encoded instruction pays for, and a pool
worker parks between jobs rather than executing anything that would clear it --
so without a barrier one forward-mode pass makes every later kernel in the
process slower, for as long as the process lives.

Timed, because there is nothing else to look at: the arithmetic, the buffers
and the kernel selected are identical either side of it. The comparison is a
ratio of two measurements taken moments apart, which is what makes it readable
on a shared machine: whatever slows one arm slows the other.

Only a build that multiversions has a wide clone to leave a state behind. Where
the kernels are compiled once -- clang, MSVC, musl, anything not x86 -- the two
arms run the same code and the ratio measures how quiet the machine was, which
is not a property of BlochSim.
