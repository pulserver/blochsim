"""A chemically exchanging pool, through the fused kernels.

Two pools that both carry transverse magnetization -- fat beside water, myelin
water beside free water, a metabolite beside its solvent. What separates this
from the semisolid pool of :mod:`test_bound_pool` is that this one precesses:
it has a T2, it sits at its own chemical shift, and a pulse rotates it rather
than saturating it. So ``F+`` and ``F-`` double, and with them the shift, the
spoil, the RF operator and what the ADC reads.

A tissue may declare this pool beside the semisolid one; what that system does
is :mod:`test_both_pools`, and this file holds the exchanging pool on its own.
