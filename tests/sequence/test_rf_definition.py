"""A pulse built from the envelope a scanner plays.

The contract is one number: an event's amplitude, written in radians, is the
flip that event turns. That holds only if the envelope is scaled so its
integral is ``1 / (2 pi)`` seconds, and a pulse handed over peak-normalized and
left that way turns a fraction of a degree instead. So the assertions here are
absolute -- against the hard pulse the same flip describes -- rather than
relative to another run of the same shaped pulse, which two nothings would
satisfy.
