"""What a bulk off-resonance does to a sample, and when it can be said in one number.

A static field offset turns the transverse states through a phase that grows
with time; the gradients wind them through one that grows with area. A state's
configuration order stands for the second, so it stands for the first as well
-- and the turn can be applied to the sample rather than carried by the states
-- exactly where the two grow together.

These pin both halves of that against the kernel that carries the field
through the states: that the signed unrefocused time each sample carries
predicts what the kernel computes, and that the verdict saying when it does is
neither optimistic nor needlessly shy. The reference is the complex kernel,
which is a different implementation of the same physics rather than a restating
of this rule.
