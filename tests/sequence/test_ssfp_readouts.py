"""The two samples an unbalanced repetition can take.

A repetition that winds every order on once has two things worth recording: the
free induction decay of the pulse that just played, and the echo the next pulse
would refocus, which is the same state read after the gradient rather than
before it. :func:`SSFPFidReadout` takes the first and :func:`SSFPEchoReadout`
the second, and this pins both against an extended phase graph written out here
from the operators in the literature rather than from anything BlochSim does.

The reference is held honest by being asked for both: it has to reproduce the
FID sample, which is what the rest of the suite and the published comparisons
already agree on, with the same shift convention that produces the echo.
