"""The builders, re-expressed as operator compositions.

The five built-in builders are the evidence that the operator vocabulary is
sufficient: each is written over operators, so each must pack to exactly the
buffers it packed to when it constructed events by hand. Bit-identity is the
bar, not agreement -- a timestamp that drifts in its last place is a
composition that computes something slightly different, and the difference
would land in an event duration.
