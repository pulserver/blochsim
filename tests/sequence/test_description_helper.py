"""Assembling a description out of operators in one call.

The claim is only that :func:`~blochsim.description` is
:func:`~blochsim.compose` with the surrounding fields filled in, so what is
checked is that a description built the short way simulates to the same signal
as one built the long way -- and that the fields a caller does not name take
values that mean "nothing here" rather than being quietly dropped.
