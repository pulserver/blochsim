"""Solving for a settled state instead of running to it.

A train that winds nothing carries one configuration order, and one order is
three numbers: a transverse magnetization, one complex number there because
``F-`` is the conjugate of ``F+``, and a longitudinal one, which is real. Both
ends of the map are reachable with nothing but the sequence -- a state is
prepared by turning equilibrium through a pulse, and read by an ADC followed by
a pulse that tips the longitudinal part into the plane -- so four prepared
states determine the whole affine map, and its fixed point is a solve rather
than a limit.

The answers are held against closed forms written out here, which is what says
the machinery reproduces the physics rather than itself.
