"""Reading the settled signal off a few playings.

A description played over and over is an affine recursion, so its samples are a
constant plus decaying modes -- exactly, because the recursion is linear. That
form has its limit fixed by finitely many terms, which is what lets a sequence
that takes thousands of playings to arrive be answered by a handful.

The transform is checked first against a sequence whose limit is written down
here, and then against the sequences it exists for, held to the answer running
to them gives.
