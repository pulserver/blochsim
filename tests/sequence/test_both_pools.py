"""Free water beside both second pools at once, through the fused kernels.

Water with fat and a macromolecular pool, or myelin water beside free water and
a macromolecular pool. Each second pool exchanges with the free water and not
with the other, so the semisolid pool of :mod:`test_bound_pool` and the
chemically exchanging pool of :mod:`test_exchange` are limits of this system
rather than neighbours of it -- which is what lets both of their answers stay
bit for bit what they were.

Only the longitudinal axis sees all three pools. The semisolid pool has no
transverse magnetization for a gradient to dephase, so the transverse step is
the same 2x2 it already was and the 3x3 is confined to ``Z``.
