"""Playing a description into the state a scanner plays it in.

A description simulated once starts from equilibrium, which is a transient a
scanner plays at the beginning of an examination and never again: every later
playing starts from whatever the one before it left. ``repetitions`` plays the
stream that many times and records the last, which is what makes a simulated
dictionary the dictionary the scanner acquires.

The settled answer is held against a closed form written out here, so what is
being checked is the physics rather than BlochSim's agreement with itself.
