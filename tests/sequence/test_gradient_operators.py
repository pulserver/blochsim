"""Naming a dephasing gradient must not change what it does.

The kernels read one action word per event: a winding before it, a winding
after it, or ideal spoiling. Writing that winding as an operator of its own,
so a Readout followed by a crusher is a composite rather than a keyword, is a
change of spelling and nothing else -- which is checkable to the bit, and is
checked that way here. ``allclose`` would pass for two different sequences
that happen to agree; only the same events give the same bits.
