"""Tabulating how well a bound pool absorbs an off-resonance pulse.

The super-Lorentzian is an integral over orientations that no kernel can
evaluate per voxel per pulse, so it is sampled over the offset and read back
between the samples. What the tests have to hold is that the integration is
the lineshape, that the interpolation is faithful between the knots, that the
stored slope is the derivative of the same integration, and that the region
near resonance -- where the integral diverges and is filled instead -- is
filled by a curve that respects the one property the lineshape certainly has:
it is even in the offset.
