"""Which terms of the state machine a tissue asks for.

A property left at the value where it has no effect is a property the kernels
need not carry: not its arithmetic, not its buffer, not a row of its gradient.
What decides is what the caller passed, read before broadcasting -- so these
pin the reading rather than the saving, because a wrong reading is a wrong
answer while a missed saving is only a slow one.
