"""What a generic model can reach, and what the engine is told when it does.

A model is where the physics is chosen, so the two things worth pinning here
are that choosing more of it works -- a second pool declared by name and
reached through the same call -- and that choosing less of it is *told* to the
engine, since a kernel that computes gradients nobody asked for gives the
right answer at twice the price.
