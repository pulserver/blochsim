"""Load the compiled kernels out of an installed wheel, and report their size.

Run by cibuildwheel against every wheel it builds, on the interpreter that
wheel claims to support. It loads each extension by file path rather than by
importing :mod:`blochsim`, so the check needs no PyTorch and says something
about the binary alone: that the stable-ABI module initialises on this
interpreter, and that it carries no vendored library.
