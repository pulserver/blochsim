"""Place a built documentation tree into the published site, one version deep.

The site is a directory per version -- ``latest`` for the development branch
and the tag for each release -- with a page at the root that sends a reader to
the newest of them, and the list the version switcher reads beside it.

The third argument is a checkout of the branch the site is served from. The
version's directory is replaced, the ones beside it are left alone, and the
root is rebuilt from whatever versions are then present.
