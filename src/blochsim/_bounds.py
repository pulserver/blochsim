"""Keeping a parameter inside its range by changing what is solved for.

A relaxation time is positive, a fraction lies in the unit interval, an
inversion efficiency cannot exceed one. None of those are preferences that
should trade against the residual -- they are what the parameter *is*, and a
solver that returns something outside them has not returned a slightly worse
answer, it has returned no answer at all.

The way to impose that is to solve for a variable the bound is a function of,
so the iterate lives in the unconstrained space and the parameter it stands
for is inside the interval by construction. A two-sided bound is a scaled
sigmoid, a one-sided bound a softplus. The chain rule factor -- the derivative
of the parameter with respect to its free variable, which :func:`widen`
returns -- multiplies the Jacobian, so the solver never sees the natural
parameter and never has to be told about the bound again.

This matters more under an encoding operator than in a voxel-wise fit. A fit
that wanders to a negative relaxation time spoils that voxel; a model-based
reconstruction evaluates the model at every voxel to predict every k-space
sample, so one voxel out of range corrupts the whole residual.

The second thing the transform does is scale. A two-sided bound maps the whole
interval onto a variable of order one, whichever units the parameter is in, so
a millisecond relaxation time and a dimensionless fraction take steps of
comparable size. That is the preconditioning a Gauss-Newton step on a mixed
parameter set needs, and it comes from the bound rather than from a table of
weights someone has to keep.

**Equality constraints are not here, and cannot be.** A constraint that fixes
one parameter in terms of the others removes a degree of freedom, so the way
to impose it is to not have that freedom: write the model on the parameters
that remain. For a fat-water fit whose two fractions must sum to one, make the
fat fraction the only unknown and write water as ``1 - f`` inside the model.
The constraint then holds identically at every iterate rather than being
restored after each one.
