"""Resolving a protocol's structure once, and binding its values per call.

A simulator called many times with the same protocol and different values --
a design loop moving flip angles, a dictionary sweeping a schedule -- rebuilds
the same event stream every time. Walking the layout, assembling the events
and packing them into buffers is per-event Python, and on a small problem it
costs an order of magnitude more than the kernels it feeds.

Nothing about the stream changes except the numbers in four of its buffers.
:class:`Packing` is that observation made usable: the structure is resolved
once, and each call rebuilds ``duration``, ``flip``, ``phase`` and the sample
times with whole-tensor arithmetic instead of one operation per event.

**Why an affine map is exact here.** A layout turns the values it is given
into event parameters by scaling and offsetting them: degrees become radians,
a flip angle is divided by the pulse's envelope integral and multiplied back
by it, a phase adds the integral's argument, a timestamp accumulates a
spacing. So each entry of a packed buffer is ``offset + scale * value`` in one
element of one argument, and two forward-mode passes recover both -- a tangent
of ones gives the scale, a tangent of ``1, 2, 3, ...`` gives the scale times
the index.

**What refuses.** A ratio that is not a whole number says an entry draws on
more than one element, and a rebuild that disagrees with a fresh packing at a
point the map never saw says the layout is not affine after all. Either one
gives no binding, and the caller keeps the ordinary path -- slower, and the
same answer.
