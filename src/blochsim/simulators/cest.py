class LorentzianSimulator(Simulator):
    """A Z-spectrum as equilibrium minus one Lorentzian line per pool.

    Each pool saturates the water signal along a Lorentzian line centred on
    its own offset [1]_, and the lines add:

    ``M0 (1 - sum_i A_i (W_i / 2)^2 / ((W_i / 2)^2 + (offset - shift_i)^2))``

    Pool ``i``, counted from one, exposes ``pool{i}_amplitude``,
    ``pool{i}_width`` (the full width at half maximum) and ``pool{i}_shift``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pools:
        How many Lorentzian lines.
    **values
        Properties or sequence arguments to fix, as for any simulator.

    At each offset the magnetization starts from equilibrium, a train of
    rectangular pulses saturates it while the free water and every exchanging
    pool precess at their own frequency, relax and exchange, and the
    longitudinal magnetization left once a spoiled delay has passed is the
    point of the spectrum. The pools are the Bloch-McConnell model's [1]_:
    ``poolB_*`` to ``poolE_*`` beside the free water, each a fraction of
    ``M0`` with its own exchange rate, relaxation times and chemical shift in
    Hz. Each pulse starts at the phase the one before it ended at, so the
    train is continuous in phase over the time the pulses play and not over
    the delays between them, which is how a Pulseq CEST protocol accumulates
    it. This is the sequence BART's ``sim`` plays as ``CEST``.
