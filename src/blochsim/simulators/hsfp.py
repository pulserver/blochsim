class HSFPSimulator(Simulator):
    """A balanced train whose flip angle varies slowly, in the hybrid state.

    With the flip angle varied slowly enough, the magnetization stays on the
    spin-locked axis the train defines and only its length evolves, relaxing
    at ``sin^2(a) / T2 + cos^2(a) / T1`` and driven by ``cos(a) / T1`` [1]_.
    The train is played repeatedly and the recorded pass starts from where the
    previous one ended, times ``beta``: ``-1`` for an inversion between
    passes, which is what makes the answer sensitive to T1 and T2 at once, and
    ``1`` for none.

    The signal is the magnetization along the spin-locked axis at each pulse,
    which for a balanced train is the transverse magnetization at the echo.
