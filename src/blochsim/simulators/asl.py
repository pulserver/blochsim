    """The label-control difference of arterial spin labelling, over time.

    The general kinetic model [1]_: labelled blood arrives after the arterial
    transit time ``ATT``, is delivered at the blood flow ``CBF`` for the
    labelling duration, and relaxes with the blood's T1 before it arrives and
    with the tissue's apparent T1, ``1 / (1 / T1 + f / lambda)``, once it has
    exchanged into tissue. Continuous and pseudo-continuous labelling deliver
    a bolus of constant concentration; pulsed labelling one whose tail left
    the labelling slab earlier and has relaxed for longer. The defaults for
    the blood's T1, the partition coefficient and the labelling efficiency
    are the consensus values at 3 T [2]_.
