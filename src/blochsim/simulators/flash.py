class FLASHSimulator(Simulator):
    """A spoiled gradient-echo train from equilibrium, optionally inverted first.

    Every excitation is a windowed sinc played sample by sample, so the
    magnetization relaxes, precesses off resonance and exchanges between pools
    while the pulse plays, unless ``pulse_duration`` is zero and it is an
    instantaneous rotation. The transverse magnetization is spoiled after each
    sample: ideally, or with ``rf_spoiling`` by a quadratic cycle of the
    excitation phase and a gradient that winds one configuration order per
    repetition [2]_, the sample then demodulated by its pulse's phase. With
    ``inversion`` the train is the inversion-recovery FLASH of Look-Locker T1
    mapping [1]_. This is the sequence BART's ``sim`` plays as ``FLASH`` and
    ``IR-FLASH``, and with instantaneous pulses and the sample at the pulse,
    the one its ``epg`` plays as FLASH.

    The configuration orders are sized from the winding when ``states`` is not
    given: one under ideal spoiling, and one per repetition up to the engine's
    limit under RF spoiling.

        Parameters
        ----------
        flip : float or array-like
            Flip angle in degrees, scalar or one per shot.
        TR : float
            Repetition time in milliseconds, pulse centre to pulse centre.
        TE : float
            Echo time in milliseconds, from the centre of the pulse.
        nshots : int
            Excitations in the train.
        pulse_duration : float, optional
            Duration of each excitation in milliseconds. Zero plays each as an
            instantaneous rotation.
        bandwidth_time : float, optional
            Zero crossings of the Hamming-windowed sinc across the pulse.
        inversion : {None, "ideal", "adiabatic"}, optional
            What prepares the train: nothing, an instantaneous inversion
            scaled by ``inv_efficiency``, or a hyperbolic secant played sample
            by sample.
        inversion_duration : float, optional
            Duration of the adiabatic inversion in milliseconds.
        inversion_phase : float, optional
            Phase of the adiabatic inversion in degrees, relative to the
            train's first pulse, which decides where the transverse
            magnetization the inversion leaves points.
        spoiler : float, optional
            Time in milliseconds between the inversion and the train, at the
            end of which the transverse magnetization is spoiled.
        dwell : float, optional
            How long each sample of a pulse is held, in milliseconds.
        rf_spoiling : float, optional
            The RF spoiling increment in degrees: the n-th excitation, counted
            from zero, is played at ``rf_spoiling * n (n + 1) / 2``. Not given,
            the transverse magnetization is spoiled ideally.

        Raises
        ------

            ``flip`` is neither scalar nor one per shot, or if a pulse is not
