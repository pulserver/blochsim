class TrueFISPSimulator(Simulator):
    """A balanced SSFP train from equilibrium, optionally inverted first.

    The pulses alternate in phase and each sample is demodulated by the phase
    of its own pulse. An alpha/2 pulse of opposite phase, played before the
    train, damps the oscillation of the approach to the steady state [1]_;
    after an inversion, the train is the inversion-recovery TrueFISP whose
    recovery curve carries T1, T2 and the proton density together [2]_. Every
    pulse is a windowed sinc played sample by sample, so the magnetization
    relaxes, precesses off resonance and exchanges between pools while it
    plays, unless ``pulse_duration`` is zero and each is an instantaneous
    rotation. This is the sequence BART's ``sim`` plays as ``BSSFP`` and
    ``IR-BSSFP``, and with instantaneous pulses the one its ``epg`` plays as
    bSSFP.

        Parameters
        ----------
        flip : float or array-like
            Flip angle in degrees, scalar or one per shot.
        TR : float
            Repetition time in milliseconds, pulse centre to pulse centre.
        nshots : int
            Excitations in the train.
        TE : float, optional
            Echo time in milliseconds, from the centre of the pulse; half the
            repetition time when not given, where a balanced train refocuses.
        pulse_duration : float, optional
            Duration of each pulse in milliseconds. Zero plays each as an
            instantaneous rotation.
        bandwidth_time : float, optional
            Zero crossings of the Hamming-windowed sinc across the pulse.
        half_alpha : bool, optional
            Whether an alpha/2 pulse prepares the train.
        preparation : float, optional
            Time in milliseconds from the start of the alpha/2 pulse to the
            start of the train's first pulse, half the repetition time when not
            given. Zero is an instantaneous alpha/2 rotation at the start of
            the train.
        inversion : {None, "ideal", "adiabatic"}, optional
            What comes before the preparation: nothing, an instantaneous
            inversion scaled by ``inv_efficiency``, or a hyperbolic secant
            played sample by sample.
        inversion_duration : float, optional
            Duration of the adiabatic inversion in milliseconds.
        inversion_phase : float, optional
            Phase of the adiabatic inversion in degrees, relative to the
            train's first pulse, which decides where the transverse
            magnetization the inversion leaves points.
        spoiler : float, optional
            Time in milliseconds between the inversion and the preparation, at
            the end of which the transverse magnetization is spoiled.
        dwell : float, optional
            How long each sample of a pulse is held, in milliseconds.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If the sample falls inside the pulse or after the next one, if the
            preparation is shorter than its pulse, if ``flip`` is neither
            scalar nor one per shot, or if a pulse is not a whole number of
            samples.
