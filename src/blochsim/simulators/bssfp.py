    """The balanced SSFP steady state, read at the echo time.

    A balanced repetition returns the transverse magnetization to where it
    started, so the steady state is a closed form in the phase a voxel accrues
    across one TR and no state machine is run. Fitting T2 to a set of these,
    given a T1 from :class:`SPGRSimulator`, is DESPOT2 [1]_.
