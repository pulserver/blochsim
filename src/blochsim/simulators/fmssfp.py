class fmSSFPSimulator(Simulator):
    """A balanced SSFP train whose RF frequency is swept through one passband per sweep.

    The n-th pulse of a sweep, counted from zero, is played ``pi + 2 pi n /
    nshots`` radians ahead of the pulse before it. A phase increment acts on
    the magnetization as an off-resonance of ``increment / (2 pi TR)``, so
    across one sweep of ``nshots`` repetitions every voxel is carried once
    through the period ``1 / TR`` of the balanced SSFP off-resonance profile
    [1]_. Each sample is demodulated by the phase of its own pulse, and
    ``sweeps`` sweeps are played before the one recorded, which is how the
    radial acquisition of [2]_ is prepared. The pulses are instantaneous
    rotations unless ``pulse_duration`` is given, and are then the windowed
    sincs :class:`TrueFISPSimulator` plays. This is the sequence BART's ``epg``
    plays as fmSSFP.

        Parameters
        ----------
        flip : float or array-like
            Flip angle in degrees, scalar or one per shot of a sweep.
        TR : float
            Repetition time in milliseconds, pulse centre to pulse centre.
        nshots : int
            Excitations in one sweep.
        sweeps : int, optional
            Sweeps played before the one recorded.
        TE : float, optional
            Echo time in milliseconds, from the centre of the pulse; half the
            repetition time when not given, where a balanced train refocuses.
        pulse_duration : float, optional
            Duration of each pulse in milliseconds. Zero plays each as an
            instantaneous rotation.
        bandwidth_time : float, optional
            Zero crossings of the Hamming-windowed sinc across a pulse.
        dwell : float, optional
            How long each sample of a pulse is held, in milliseconds.
