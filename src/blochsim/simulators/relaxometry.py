class InversionRecoverySimulator(Simulator):
    """Longitudinal recovery from an inversion, read at a series of delays.

    A spin echo long enough after the inversion samples the longitudinal
    magnetization alone, so the contrast is the recovery curve itself. The
    repetition time bounds how much the magnetization has recovered by the
    time the next inversion arrives; leave it out for a fully relaxed one.

    ``offset`` is a constant added to the recovery, which is what a magnitude
    reconstruction's noise floor looks like to a fit and what stops the
    fitted T1 absorbing it.
