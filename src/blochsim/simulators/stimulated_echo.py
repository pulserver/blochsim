class StimulatedEchoSimulator(Simulator):
    """Three pulses, sampled at the spin echo of the first two and at the stimulated echo.

    The second pulse, ``TE / 2`` after the first, refocuses part of the
    transverse magnetization into a spin echo at ``TE`` and stores part of it
    along z, where it relaxes with T1 alone; the third pulse, ``TM`` after the
    second, returns that part to the transverse plane, where it rephases into
    the stimulated echo ``TE / 2`` later [1]_. With instantaneous pulses about
    x, the two samples are ``i M0 sin(a1) sin^2(a2 / 2) exp(-TE / T2)`` and
    ``i M0 sin(a1) sin(a2) sin(a3) exp(-TE / T2) exp(-TM / T1) / 2``, whatever
    the off-resonance. The transverse magnetization is spoiled after the spin
    echo, so the second sample is the stimulated echo alone. With one flip
    angle, and ``TE`` twice and ``TM`` three times its own echo time, this is
    the sequence BART's ``epg`` plays as Spinecho.

        Parameters
        ----------
        flip : float or array-like
            Flip angle in degrees, scalar or one per pulse.

            Echo time in milliseconds: twice the spacing of the first two
