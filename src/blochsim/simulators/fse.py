    The pulses after the central one replay those before it in reverse order,

    about ``-phi``, which is ``alpha`` at ``180 - phi`` degrees -- so every
    coherence pathway the first half split is brought back by the last echo,
    the hyperecho [1]_. But for relaxation, that echo is the full spin echo of
    the excitation, whatever the flip angles before it. Every echo is
    demodulated at zero phase, the axis of the central pulse. With one flip
    angle at zero phase throughout, this is the sequence BART's ``epg`` plays
