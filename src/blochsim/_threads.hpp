// dirty, and on Intel parts every SSE-encoded instruction executed afterwards
// -- everything in a translation unit built for the base architecture, libm's
// ``expf`` among it -- then pays a transition penalty until something clears
// them. A thread that returns to Python clears them within moments because
// everything around it is AVX-encoded; a worker parks in a wait and carries
// the state to its next job, which is how one forward-mode pass can leave a
// pool running every later kernel at a third of its speed.
//
// One instruction per job settles it. ``vzeroupper`` faults on a processor
// with no AVX at all, hence the runtime test, and the clobber list is what
// tells the compiler not to hold a vector value across it.
