"""Reading the settled signal off a few playings instead of running thousands.

A description played over and over is an affine recursion on its states,
``x(n) = T x(n-1) + b``. Subtracting the fixed point leaves ``e(n) = T e(n-1)``,
so expanding in the eigenvectors of ``T`` and reading the sample as a linear
functional of the state gives

    s(n) = s(inf) + sum_j a_j lambda_j**n

exactly, for as long as the recursion is linear -- which it is. A sequence of
that form has its limit determined by finitely many of its terms: ``2m+1`` of
them fix ``s(inf)`` together with ``m`` amplitudes and ``m`` eigenvalues. That
is the Shanks transform of order ``m``, evaluated here by Wynn's epsilon
algorithm.

So this is not a fit or a guess at a trend. It solves for the limit of a
sequence whose form is known, and it recovers the eigenvalues of the transition
operator on the way -- without ever forming that operator, which for an
unbalanced train would be a dense matrix per voxel.

Its weakness is conditioning: the transform divides by differences of
differences, and once the terms are close together those are round-off. The
order is therefore chosen by how little the answer moves when it is raised,
rather than taken as high as the terms allow.
