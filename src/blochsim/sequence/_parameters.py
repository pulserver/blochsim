"""The state machine's parameters, as data.

The kernels take a flat list of buffers: the tissue properties, then the packed
per-event buffers. Their order is an ABI shared by the Python dispatch, the
CPU extension and the Triton kernels, and the counts derived from it -- how
many buffers are saved for backward, which of them carry gradients, how wide
the raw pointer array is -- appear in all three. This module is where that
order is written down, so those counts are read from one place instead of
being repeated as literals.

``identity`` is the value at which a parameter has no effect on the answer.
It is what lets a run decide which terms the kernel actually has to execute.
