"""Clustering a dictionary so most of it can be ruled out per voxel.

Bloch simulations over a parameter grid are not spread evenly through signal
space: neighbouring tissues make nearly parallel signals, so a dictionary is
already clustered before anything is done to it. Grouping it and giving each
group one representative signal turns matching into two much smaller problems
-- which groups could this voxel be in, and which atom inside them -- and the
first answer rules out almost all of the second.

Compression comes first and is global. A dictionary is projected onto one
temporal basis, stored as ``(atoms, rank)``, and clustered in that basis; the
signals arrive in the same basis, whether projected on the way in or solved
for there by a subspace reconstruction. One basis for everything is what lets
a group be entered without leaving the space the measurement is in. The two
savings are then independent and multiply: the basis shortens every inner
product, the grouping cuts how many are taken.

The grouping and pruning are those of Cauley, S. F., Setsompop, K., Ma, D., et
al., "Fast group matching for MR fingerprinting reconstruction", Magnetic
Resonance in Medicine 74.2 (2015), pp. 523-528.
