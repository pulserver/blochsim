"""Stating a sequence-design problem, and solving it.

A design problem is three things, and this module is one object for each.

The **acquisition** is a simulator with the tissue it is being designed for
already fixed on it, so only the parameters under design are left to give. It
answers the same two questions any simulator does -- what is recorded, and how
that changes with the tissue -- which is what lets a cost be written against
the simulator's own vocabulary.

The **cost** is a plain function the user writes. It takes the parameters
being designed by name, asks its acquisitions what they record, and returns
one number. Nothing about it is registered or declared.

:class:`SequenceDesign` holds the cost and the parameters, each with the
limits it may move between, and :meth:`SequenceDesign.minimize` runs the loop.
The gradient is reverse-mode autograd on the cost: the engine reads which of
its inputs carry one and picks its kernel from that, so a design loop needs no
derivative of its own.

The two families this has to carry look nothing alike, which is the point.
A quantitative sequence is designed for **precision** -- the cost is a
Cramer-Rao bound on what it estimates, and reads the acquisition's Jacobian.
An anatomical sequence is designed for **image quality** -- the cost is a
property of the point spread function the echo train produces, and reads the
signal alone. Both are the same object with a different function in it.

    Parameters
    ----------
    jacobian : torch.Tensor
        ``(..., parameters, samples)`` -- the derivative of the signal with
        respect to each parameter being estimated. Real and imaginary parts
        are counted as separate measurements, which is what independent
        Gaussian noise on the two channels means.
    noise_variance : float, optional
        The variance of that noise, in the units the signal is in.
    singular : {"raise", "infinite"}, optional
        What to do where the parameters are not jointly identifiable. The
        default refuses, which is right for a design being scored: a
        sequence that cannot separate its parameters has no bound to
        report. ``"infinite"`` answers with an infinite variance at those
        entries instead, which is what a map wants, since one voxel of
        background need not stop the rest from being read.

    Returns
    -------
    torch.Tensor
        ``(..., parameters)``, the diagonal of the inverse Fisher matrix. What
        to do with it is the design's: summing gives A-optimality, dividing by
        the parameter values first makes the sum dimensionless and so weights
        a short and a long relaxation time comparably.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the Jacobian has no parameter axis.
    torch.linalg.LinAlgError
        If the parameters are not jointly identifiable from these samples,
        which is a singular Fisher matrix and says the design cannot work at
        all rather than that it is imprecise.
