"""A low-rank temporal basis, and what it keeps.

The signals a sequence can produce do not fill the space its contrasts span.
A few hundred echoes of a relaxation-driven train lie close to a subspace of a
dozen or so directions, and every dimension dropped is arithmetic that neither
a dictionary match nor a kernel regression has to do.

What makes the trade safe is that the error is known. The singular values the
basis is read from say exactly how much of the signal energy is left outside
it, so a rank is chosen against a number rather than a hope.
