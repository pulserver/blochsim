"""Inverting the forward operator, one linearized problem at a time.

Every Newton-type method for a nonlinear inverse problem does the same thing:
linearize where it stands, solve the linear problem that leaves, step, repeat.

    x_{n+1} = x_n + argmin_d || DF(x_n) d + F(x_n) - y ||^2 + a_n R(x_n + d)

What separates the methods is *how the linear problem is solved* and *where the
damping comes from*, and both belong to the caller.

The linear solve is a callable, and mostly it is somebody else's.
:func:`iterative` takes any :class:`LeastSquares` -- anything minimizing
``||A d - b||^2 + (1/g) ||d - z||^2`` from products with the Jacobian alone,
which is exactly what a Gauss-Newton step leaves. Given nothing it reaches
deepinv's ``least_squares``. There is no conjugate gradient written here and
there should not be: a package that ships its own is one more copy of an
algorithm nobody wanted three of.

:func:`direct` is the exception, and only because it is not a general linear
solver: where the operator is voxel-diagonal the problem is a stack of small
independent least-squares systems, and one batched factorization over all of
them is the Levenberg-Marquardt step itself. That factorization is
:func:`torch.linalg.lstsq`.

Anything with the same signature does, and wrapping an external proximal
solver is how a regularizer enters -- which is the difference between an
iteratively regularized Gauss-Newton solved by conjugate gradients and one
solved by FISTA under an L1 prior.

The damping is a policy. :class:`Schedule` lowers one number geometrically and
accepts every step, which is the iteratively regularized Gauss-Newton the
model-based reconstruction literature runs. :class:`TrustRegion` gives each
voxel its own damping, accepts or rejects on whether the step actually helped,
and retires voxels as they converge -- which is Levenberg-Marquardt. The
second is the first with the bookkeeping that independent rows make possible,
and the two land in the same place on a problem both can solve.
